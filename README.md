# Duality
## 1. About
Duality is a twin stick shooter video game. In this game you control a shape which can shoot down enemies.
The unique mechanic of Duality is that there are two "Polarities", which are represented by different colors.
When a player hits an enemy of the same color (or vice versa), no damage is applied.
This requires the player to constantly switch colors in order to defeat the most enemies.
